# Weather Dashboard


## Description

The weather dashboard has form inputs that allow users to search for a city. Upon searching, the dashboard displays current and future weather conditions for that city, and adds it to the search history. The current weather conditions include the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The future weather conditions include a 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Users can also click on a city in the search history to view its current and future weather conditions.
